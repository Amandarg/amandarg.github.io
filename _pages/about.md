Hi! I recently joined Twitter's META (Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability) team in [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com) as a machine learning researcher. I received my PhD from the [Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/ph-d-programs/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html) program at the University of Michigan. I was co-advised by [Laura Balzano](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Martin Strauss](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/). I was fortunate to be partially supported by a NSF graduate research fellowship.

My research is broadly in machine learning. I enjoy problems that are theoretically sound yet practically motivated. I especially like working on problems that can have a positive societal impact. My recent research interests include

* algorithmic fairness and bias,
* rankings and preference learning, and
* algorithmic fairness and bias specifically in the ranking setting.


See my publications [here](https://amandarg.github.io/publications/) and my CV [here](../files/Amanda_Bower_CV.pdf).
