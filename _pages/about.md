Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/ph-d-programs/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html) program at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Martin Strauss](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/). I have been fortunate to be supported by a NSF graduate research fellowship.

My research is broadly in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in both preference learning and algorithmic fairness.

See my publications [here](https://amandarg.github.io/publications/) and my CV [here](https://amandarg.github.io/cv/).
